# Loan Default Prediction

This repository contains the code and analysis for the **Loan Default Prediction** project completed as part of the Coursera Data Science Coding Challenge 

## Project Overview
This project aimed to predict loan defaults using a real-world dataset. The goal was to build a reliable classification model by performing data analysis, feature engineering, and experimenting with various machine learning algorithms.

## Approach
The workflow followed in this project includes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed data distributions and relationships.
2. **Feature Engineering and Selection:**
   - Handled missing values, created new features, and selected important variables.
3. **Scaling/Normalization:**
   - Applied data normalization techniques for improved model performance.
4. **Model Selection and Evaluation:**
   - Experimented with multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and XGBoost.
5. **Final Model Choice:**
   - The XGBoost classifier was chosen for the final model due to its superior performance.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Data Visualization
